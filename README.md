# exceltodb
This is a simplified program to take an excel file and
load it into sqlite3, then display that data in a tabular or
graph format.

For this program to work, have these installed using pip:
    <li>pip install openpyxl (xlrd did not work)
    <li>pip install numpy
    <li>pip install pandas
    <li>pip install matplotlib
    <li>pip install scikit-learn
    <li>pip install sklearn

    -- also this python file needs to be in the same
        directory as the excel file (retailsales.xlsx)

Note: If the program is quit using option "3", then the sqlite
database file does not need to be manually deleted before running
the program again.
